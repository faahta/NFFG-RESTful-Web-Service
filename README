a RESTful web service to verify different types of policies (reachability, traversal..) of Network function flow graphs (NFFGs).

Setting the work environment for the project
--------------------------------------------
After Tomcat installation, set the Tomcat-related properties in tomcat-build.xml.
You can create a single eclipse java project for this package and then add the
jars under lib to the build path. It is also suggested to attach the sources
available in lib-src to the corresponding jar library.
DO NOT USE tomcat-build.xml directly. Instead use the build.xml (which imports it).

Start tomcat by running the start-tomcat target
(from build.xml).
